# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. I used a combination of JavaScript for the application and HTML code. In the dashboard, the user can find and interact with a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual and a bubble chart that displays each sample. The dashboard also displays the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
